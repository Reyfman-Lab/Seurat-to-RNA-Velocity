# Seurat to RNA-Velocity
#### *By Basil Khuder*

This guide will show you how you can use a processed/normalized Seurat object in conjunction with your RNA Velocity analysis. 
We will be using the following programs: <br>

- [scVelo](https://github.com/theislab/scvelo) (For RNA Velocity)
- [Velocyto](http://velocyto.org/) (To produce our initial RNA Velocity Object)
- [Anndata](https://icb-anndata.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/stable/) (For manipulation of our RNA Velocity object)
- Seurat
- Samtools 
 -- *optional* (Velocyto will run Samtools sort on unsorted .bam)

To start, we'll be generating loom files for every single-cell sample you used in your Seurat analysis using Velocyto's <br>```velocyto run```

*Although there are a plethora of more up-to-date and less memory intensive software to produce the spliced/unspliced matrix required
for RNA Velocity, Velocyto's run command is still a more straightforward approach.*

Note that I've found it better to use ```velocyto run``` for whichever scRNA-seq chemistry you are working with rather than Velocyto's "ready-to-use subcommands." 
```
velocyto run -b filtered_barcodes.tsv -o output_path -m repeat_msk_srt.gtf bam_file.bam annotation.gtf
```
Once this step has finished and your loom file is generated, we can go ahead and use anndata to import our loom file and make the necessary adjustments/additions. If you'd like a more interactive visualization for the rest of this guide,
a jupyter notebook is provided here.

But, before we do that, we will export all of the necessary meta data from our Seurat object that we will need for our RNA Velocity object. This includes:

- Filtered Cell IDS
- UMAP or TSNE coordinates
- Clusters

One way we can access our filtered Cell ID's is through Seurat's ```GetAssayData``` function and extract the column names:

```
%%R
write.table(colnames(GetAssayData(seurat_object)), file = "cellID_obs.csv")
```
*If you have a Seurat object that is composed of multiple single-cell samples, you either can use the code above, and then later
on use some type of pattern to extract each sample (for example, if you added unique cell prefixes to each sample then you
could use that pattern.)  Likewise, you can also create a cell ID observation file for every sample, and use each one 
individually to filter each RNA Velocity object.*

To get UMAP or TSNE coordinates, we use the ```Embeddings``` function:
```
%%R
write.table(Embeddings(seurat_object, reduction = "umap"), file = "cell_embeddings.csv")
```
And finally we can extract our clusters with: 

```
%%R
write.table(seurat_object@meta.data$seurat_clusters, file = "clusters.csv")
```

We now can import our loom file(s) and all of our Seurat meta data using anndata

```
import anndata
import scvelo as scv
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib as plt
%load_ext rpy2.ipython

sample_one = anndata.read_loom("sample_one.loom")
....
sample_n = anndata.read_loom("sample_n.loom")

sample_obs = pd.read_csv("cellID_obs.csv")
umap_cord = pd.read_csv("cell_embeddings.csv")
cell_clusters = pd.read_csv("clusters_obs.csv")
```

With our extracted Cell IDs from Seurat, we'll need to filter our uploaded loom (now as an anndata object) based upon them.  

```
sample_one = sample_one[sample_one[np.isin(sample_one.obs.index,cellID_obs[0])]]
```
**If your Seurat Object has multiple samples**<br>
-------------------------------------------------
If you have individual observation files for every sample, you'll do the filtering above one by one.  If you have a combined observation file, you'll want to filter it based upon the cell pattern and then use that to filter the RNA Velocity sample. For example, if these
were your Cell IDs:
<br><br>

| Sample Cell IDs | 
| ------------- | 
| sample1_ACTCACT |
| sample1_ACTCCAC |
|  .....          |
| sample2_CACACTG |

<br>

You could use the pattern sample1_, sample2_, to filter as such:

```
cellID_obs_sample_one = cellID_obs[cellID_obs_sample_one[0].str.contrains("sample1_")]
cellID_obs_sample_two = cellID_obs[cellID_obs_sample_two[0].str.contrains("sample2_")]
sample_one = sample_one[sample_one[np.isin(sample_one.obs.index,cellID_obs_sample_one)]]
sample_two = sample_two[sample_one[np.isin(sample_two.obs.index,cellID_obs_sample_two)]]
```
Once all the samples have been properly filtered, we can merge them into one. 
```
sample_one = sample_one.concatenate(sample_two,sample_three,sample_four)
```
-------------------------------------------------
Now that we have our Velocity file filtered based upon our Seurat object, we can go ahead and add UMAP coordinates.
